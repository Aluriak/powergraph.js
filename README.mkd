# Power Graph with Cytoscape
Proof of concept for the visualization of [Power Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power%5Fgraph%5Fanalysis) with [cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org).

## setup
Install the needed javascript files in `site/js/`:
- [cytoscape.min.js](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/tree/master/dist)
- [cytoscape-cose-bilkent.js](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-cose-bilkent/blob/master/cytoscape-cose-bilkent.js) module, improving compound support

## examples
See `Makefile` for automatic setup of site example. For instance, `make basics` for a basic usage of Cytoscape.js.
